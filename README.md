📢 Project: TND232 – RS232 & USB SN76489 Tandy Sound Card

Home Project Site: https://www.retroianer.de

TND232 is a retro-computing hardware and software project to bring authentic Tandy/PCjr style 3-voice sound to IBM-PC compatible computers using modern interfaces like RS232 (serial) and USB, driven by the classic Texas Instruments SN76489 programmable sound generator chip.

🎯 Overview

Many classic DOS games support the Tandy 1000’s 3-voice audio produced by the SN76489 sound chip, but modern vintage add-ons like ISA boards aren’t always practical for newer PCs or laptops without expansion slots. The TND232 project provides an interface to control an SN76489 sound generator externally:

Serial (RS232) interface – connect via the PC’s COM port

USB interface – USB-powered control for systems without RS232

Drives an SN76489 sound module (3 square waves + noise) for authentic sound output on classic software

Includes DOS drivers/utilities to support music and game sound

The goal is to offer a flexible, cross-platform way to add real retro sound hardware to DOS machines without needing an ISA expansion card, while preserving authentic Tandy audio for games and demos.
